But, it is widely used in classification objectives.The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N — the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they’re able to categorize new text.\n\nThe advantages of support vector machines are:\n\n        Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n\n        Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n\n        Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n\n        Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n\nThe disadvantages of support vector machines include:\n\n        If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n\n        SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n\n**References:**\n1. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html\n1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/support-vector-machine"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = svm.SVC() #select the algorithm\nmodel.fit(train_X,train_y) # we train the algorithm with the training data and the training output\nprediction=model.predict(test_X) #now we pass the testing data to the trained algorithm\nprint('The accuracy of the SVM is:',metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y))#now we check the accuracy of the algorithm. \n#we pass the predicted output by the model and the actual output","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Logistic Regression**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = LogisticRegression()\nmodel.fit(train_X,train_y)\nprediction=model.predict(test_X)\nprint('The accuracy of the Logistic Regression is',metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# **K-Nearest Neighbours**\nThe K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning algorithms. KNN is extremely easy to implement in its most basic form, and yet performs quite complex classification tasks. It is a lazy learning algorithm since it doesn't have a specialized training phase. Rather, it uses all of the data for training while classifying a new data point or instance. KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data. This is an extremely useful feature since most of the real world data doesn't really follow any theoretical assumption e.g. linear-separability, uniform distribution, etc. \nThe intuition behind the KNN algorithm is one of the simplest of all the supervised machine learning algorithms. It simply calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training data points. The distance can be of any type e.g Euclidean or Manhattan etc. It then selects the K-nearest data points, where K can be any integer. Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model=KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=15) #this examines 3 neighbours for putting the new data into a class\nmodel.fit(train_X,train_y)\nprediction=model.predict(test_X)\nprint('The accuracy of the KNN is',metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap\nfrom sklearn import neighbors, datasets\n\nn_neighbors = 26\n\n# import some data to play with\niris = datasets.load_iris()\n\n# we only take the first two features.
